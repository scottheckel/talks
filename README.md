The web was meant to be enjoyed by everyone and progressive enhancement is a strategy that will allow all of your users to enjoy the same content. We will take a hands-on look at how the concept of progressive enhancement of JavaScript will enhance your customers experience with only a little extra thought and elbow grease from your development team. Finally, we’ll take a look at where progressive enhancement sits in the modern world of single page applications. Basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS understanding are fundamental to this talk with some brief server-side content (ASP.NET and Node.js discussed).
