#Untangle Your Front End Development with Visual Studio 2015
* Twin Cities Code Camp - April 2015

Microsoft has enhanced the VS tooling to support the front end development standards. In this session, we will setup a web project and learn to utilize node, npm, grunt, gulp, sass and bower to get our website up and running. Never heard of those tools before? Don't worry. We will cover that too.
